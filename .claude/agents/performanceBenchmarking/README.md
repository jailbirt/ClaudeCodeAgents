## Combining Agents

Testing and performance agents work together for comprehensive quality assurance:

1. **Performance Optimization**: performance-benchmarker + api-tester + backend-architect
2. **Testing Strategy**: test-results-analyzer + test-writer-fixer + workflow-optimizer
3. **Tool Migration**: tool-evaluator + workflow-optimizer + relevant engineering agents
4. **Quality Improvement**: All testing agents + analytics-reporter

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing agents follow these principles:

- **Preventive**: Catch issues before users do
- **Comprehensive**: Test at every level
- **Automated**: Minimize manual testing
- **Data-Driven**: Measure everything
- **Continuous**: Test early and often
